## Course Description 
Today’s internet, made up of mostly text documents and two-dimensional images and videos, is the result of historical limitations in bandwidth, graphics processing and input devices. These limitations have made the internet a place where the mind goes, but the body cannot follow. Recent advances in motion capture devices, graphics processing, machine learning, bandwidth and browsers, however, are paving the way for the body to find its place online. This course will explore embodied interactions in the browser and across networks. Specifically we’ll explore TensorFlow.js models like PoseNet and BodyPix, and Microsoft Kinect in p5.js and Three.js. Assignments will consider designing engaging embodied experiences for individual and social interactions online. Experience with Node, HTML and JavaScript is helpful but not required. ICM level programming experience is required.

## Evaluation and Policies 

See [Evaluation and Policies](/policies.md).

## Guidelines 
A big part of learning at ITP is learning from each other. So share your work and in exchange you'll get to see everyone else's!

1. Do the assignments.
2. Contribute to discussions.
3. Post documentation: Ideally something visual, some written thoughts, and code. If you are struggling with your sketch and can't get things to work, put your energy into writing about what didn't work and what you did to try to solve it.

## Attendance 
Please be on time! I commit to ending class on time, which means I will start class on time so we can get through all class material. 

According to the [ITP/IMA Class Attendance policy](http://facultyhelp.itp.nyu.edu/academic-policies/itp-ima-class-attendance-policy), for 7-week, and 6-week, half-term courses, up to one unexcused absence is permitted. Exceeding these unexcused absence guidelines is grounds for automatic failure. I really don't want to fail you, so please please please communicate with me about your schedule and needs. 

Please review the attendance and participation requirements under [Evaluation and Policies](/policies.md). 

## Code of Conduct 

Over these seven weeks we are going on an exciting and difficult journey together. In order to learn and innovate, it's important for all of us to create an atmosphere that celebrates our vulnerability and diversity. Please review the ITP/IMA [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ITPNYU/ITP-IMA-Code-of-Conduct) and [Rules of Play](https://github.com/ITPNYU/ITP-IMA-Code-of-Conduct/blob/main/rules-of-play.md). 

If you are uncomfortable with any of the class proceedings, you are always welcome to reach out to me (lisa.jamhoury@nyu.edu), our area head Mimi Yin (mimi.yin@nyu.edu), the [Bias Response Line](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/equal-opportunity/bias-response/report-a-bias-incident.html), or [Title IX](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/equal-opportunity/title9/reporting-and-resources/reporting-options.html).

## Mode of Instruction 
This course will be offered entirely online. We will meet on Zoom at our regularly scheduled time to share homework and to discuss the week's topics. About an hour of course time will be devoted to technical topics. We'll discuss as a class how to best present the technical lecture, but I'm leaning toward doing the technical lecture live and making a recording of it available asynchronously. This way, students who would like to watch live and ask questions have that opportunity, but students who prefer to have a shorter class time are welcome to watch later. 

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions. These are unprecedented times, and I'm happy to discuss how I can make the class work for each of you.

## Class Recordings
All class lectures will be recorded to accommodate students who miss class. Recordings will not be shared publicly and will not be available after the semester ends. Please reach out to me if you do not feel comfortable being recorded.

## Support 
If you find yourself struggling, remember that you have many forms of support that you can take advantage of at ITP. Look out for the [office hours and help sessions that the residents offer](https://itp.nyu.edu/residents/contact-the-residents/). You can find my office hours [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUlFdHBUdGtNZlpEfGRlZmF1bHR8NGM3YjcyZWMxYWNkZDc1M2YxMTE5MjFjNWU5ODVkMjY) and my email is lisa.jamhoury@nyu.edu. Don't hesitate to reach out!

## Homework Assignments
Assignments are due **before** class each week. I will not give credit for assignments that are turned in late. Keeping in mind that I want you to succeed, and that the material can sometimes be challenging, **I absolutely prefer tentative work with good documentation to work that is turned in late**.

[Use this form to turn in your homework assignments](https://forms.gle/uyeKxox99DsHX88w8). 

[Here's the spreadsheet with everyone's responses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/104GQ4UCZBFAeqXm1Vev7fK8VfNknCsOuDzvl1WN6sMc/edit?usp=sharing). 

## Homework Partner Program 
Every week you will have a partner to work on homework with. You **must** user test with each other! From there, it is up to you and your partner how you will engage. You can work together on the assignement. You can work independently, then user test your work. You can work independently, but pair program throughout the week. 

My un-intelligent program will pair you in the first four weeks. You are welcome to switch partners as long as you work with different partners throughout the first four weeks. You will pick your own partner for the final assignment. 

## Final Assignment 
The final two weeks of class will be devoted to final projects. Use this assignment to delve more deeply into the subject matter in one piece of work. You can decide with your partner whether you prefer to work independently or as a pair. 

This will comprise 20% of your grade. You will not be graded on whether it works on not, you will be graded on your process and documentation. So, please! make sure that you leave time to document your project well!

#### Assignments 

* Create a sketch using the pixel array that encourages the user to use their body in some way. User test with your partner. Focus on what it _feels_ like, not (or in addition to) what it looks like. 
* Create at least two variations on the sketch that encourage the user to interact with your sketch in a specific way. * Consider: Moving away from your computer to test with the full body or using an external webcam placed away from you to capture your full body.  
* Write a blog post to document the process of creating your sketch. Submit it in the [Homework form](https://forms.gle/uyeKxox99DsHX88w8).
