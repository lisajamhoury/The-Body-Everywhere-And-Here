## Course Description 
Today’s internet, made up of mostly text documents and two-dimensional images and videos, is the result of historical limitations in bandwidth, graphics processing and input devices. These limitations have made the internet a place where the mind goes, but the body cannot follow. Recent advances in motion capture devices, graphics processing, machine learning, bandwidth and browsers, however, are paving the way for the body to find its place online. This course will explore embodied interactions in the browser and across networks. Specifically we’ll explore TensorFlow.js models like PoseNet and BodyPix, and Microsoft Kinect in p5.js and Three.js. Assignments will consider designing engaging embodied experiences for individual and social interactions online. Experience with Node, HTML and JavaScript is helpful but not required. ICM level programming experience is required.

## Guidelines 
A big part of learning at ITP is learning from each other. So share your work and in exchange you'll get to see everyone else's!

1. Do the assignment.
2. Contribute a question.
3. Post blog documentation: Ideally something visual, some written thoughts, and code. If you are struggling with your sketch and can't get things to work, put your energy into writing about what didn't work and what you did to try to solve it.

## Attendance 
Please be on time! I fear 9am like the rest of you, but I commit to ending class on time, which means I will start class at 9am on the dot so we have enough time to get through all class material. Please review the attendance and participation requirements under [Evaluation and Policies](/policies.md).

## Homework Assignments
Assignments are due the night before class each week. I will not give credit for assignments that are turned in late. Keeping in mind that I want you to succeed, and that the material can sometimes be challenging, **I absolutely prefer tentative work with good documentation to work that is turned in late**.

XXXXX Use this form to turn in your homework assignments. XXXXX

## Homework Partner Program 
Every week you will have a partner to work on homework with. You **must** user test with each other! From there, it is up to you and your partner how you will engage. You can work together on the assignement. You can work independently, then user test your work. You can work independently, but pair program throughout the week. 

My un-intelligent program will pair you in the first four weeks. You are welcome to switch partners as long as you work with different partners throughout the first four weeks. 

You will pick your own partner for the final assignment. 

## Final Assignment 
The final two weeks of class will be devoted to final projects. Use this assignment to delve more deeply into the subject matter in one piece of work. You can decide with your partner whether you prefer to work independently or as a pair. 

This will comprise 20% of your grade. You will not be graded on whether it works on not, you will be graded on your process and documentation. So, please! make sure that you leave time to document your project well!
